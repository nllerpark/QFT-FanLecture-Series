## 🎯 Project Description

> *Exploding QFT: A Fan-Driven Lecture Series* is a creative and educational quantum physics project that blends rigorous theoretical exposition with narrative elements from popular culture.
>
> This first lecture, titled “If Dirac Teaches Megumin Quantum Mechanics: A Courtroom Play,” uses familiar characters (e.g., Dirac, Megumin, Aqua) to introduce foundational quantum concepts such as state superposition, measurement collapse, operator quantization, and entanglement.
>
> Designed for learners with a background in physics or an interest in fan-based science storytelling, this lesson bridges formal quantum mechanics and intuitive narrative.
>
> All characters referenced are publicly documented figures from well-known media, cited via English Wikipedia.  
> This material is intended for educational and non-commercial use under a Creative Commons license.
