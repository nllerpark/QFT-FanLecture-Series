## 🎯 Project Description

> *Exploding QFT: A Fan-Driven Lecture Series* is a creative and educational quantum physics project that blends rigorous theoretical exposition with narrative elements from popular culture.
>
> These lectures use fictionalized courtroom drama and anime characters to explore deep ideas in quantum mechanics such as state superposition, measurement theory, energy quantization, decoherence, and causality.
>
> Designed for learners with a background in physics or an interest in fan-based science storytelling, this series bridges formal quantum mechanics and intuitive narrative.
>
> All characters referenced are publicly documented figures from well-known media, cited via English Wikipedia.  
> This material is intended for educational and non-commercial use under a Creative Commons license.
